One-Lin3r is a simple and lightweight framework inspired by the web delivery module in Metasploit.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/157020.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/157020?autoplay=1)

It consists of various one-liners that aid in penetration testing operations:
- **Reverser**: Give it an IP & port and it returns a reverse shell liner ready for copy & paste.
- **Dropper**: Give it an uploaded-backdoor URL and it returns a download-&-execute liner ready for copy & paste.
- **Other**: Holds liners with general purpose to help in penetration testing (ex: Mimikatz, Powerup, etc...) on the trending OS's (Windows, Linux, and macOS) "More OS's can be added too".

## Features
- Search for any one-liner in the database by its full or partial name.
- You can add your own liners by [following these steps](https://github.com/D4Vinci/One-Lin3r/wiki) to create a ".liner" file. Also you can send it to me directly and it will be added in the framework and credited with your name :smile:.
- Autocomplete any framework command and recommendations in case of typos (in case you love hacking like movies :laughing:).
- Command line arguments can be used to give the framework a resource file to load and execute for automation.
- The ability to reload the database if you added any liner without restarting the framework.
- You can add any platform to the payloads database just by making a folder in the payloads folder and creating a ".liner" file there.
- More...

The payloads database is not big now because this the first edition, but it will get bigger with updates and contributions.
